# OpenSAFELY COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Report

This is the code and configuration of our pre-print paper available on MedRxiv here (NB currently undergoing screening, link will be updated when available). You can sign up for the [OpenSAFELY email newsletter here](https://opensafely.org/contact/) for updates about the COVID-19 vaccine reports and other OpenSAFELY projects.

- Jupyter notebooks containing all graphs including reports for STPs* in England are in /notebooks. If notebooks do not load you can use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
- If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/). All codelists are available online at [OpenCodelists](https://codelists.opensafely.org/) for inspection and re-use by anyone 
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)

# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a secure analytics platform for
electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and
transporting them elsewhere for analysis, the framework supports
developing analytics against dummy data, and then running against the
real data *within the same infrastructure that the data is stored*.
Read more at [OpenSAFELY.org](https://opensafely.org). 

*STP level reports have been generated for all STPs where TPP software coverage exceeds 10%
