    "\n",
    "**This notebook accompanies [this paper (add link)](), describing trends and variation in clinical activity codes using a set of key measures indicative of overall activity to evaluate NHS service restoration throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the OpenSAFELY SRO is to describe trends and variation in clinical activity codes to evaluate NHS service restoration during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a set of key GP measures at the practice level, that are indicative of changes in overall activity during the pandemic. For each of these measures we provide a link to the codelist containing all the codes used for that measure, a description of what the measure is and a brief overview of why the measure is important. We also highlight any caveats, where there are any, for each measure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly rates of recorded activity are displayed as practice level decile charts to show both the general trend and practice level variation in activity changes. Accompanying each chart is a summary of the most commonly recorded SNOMED codes for each measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each measure we also indicate the number of unique patients recorded as having at least one event indicated by the measure as well as the total number of events since January 2019.\n",
    "A summary of the number of events for each measure is produced and monthly rates of recorded activity for each measure is plotted as a decile chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each measure, we also median activity rate in April 2019 (baseline) and the percentage change from this median in April 2020 (time of the 1st national lockdown) and April 2021. These changes are used to give an overall classification of activity change as described in the box below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No change: no change from baseline in both April 2020 and April 2021.\n",
    "* Increase: an increase from baseline in either April 2020 or April 2021.\n",
    "* Sustained drop: a drop from baseline of >15% in April 2020 which **has not** returned to within 15% of the baseline by April 2021.\n",
    "* Recovery: a drop of >15% from baseline in April 2020 which **has** returned to within 15% of the baseline by April 2021.\n",
