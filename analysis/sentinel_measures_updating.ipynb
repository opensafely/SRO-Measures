    "\n",
    "**This notebook accompanies [this report](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/sro-measures/), describing trends and variation in clinical activity codes using a set of key measures indicative of overall activity to evaluate NHS service restoration throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This version includes data from the EHR provider TPP only and will be updated regularly. For a more detailed analysis please see the report linked above and the accompanying paper.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each key measure we provide a link to the codelist containing all the codes used for that measure, a description of what the measure is and a brief overview of why the measure is important.  We also highlight any caveats, where there are any, for each measure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly rates of recorded activity are displayed as practice level decile charts to show both the general trend and practice level variation in activity changes. For more information on why we use decile charts to communicate variation in activity, please see [this blog post](https://www.thedatalab.org/blog/2019/04/communicating-variation-in-prescribing-why-we-use-deciles/).\n",
